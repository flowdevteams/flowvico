Our brains crave the comfort reliability and consistency breeds. We're confused when we see someone act one way and that way changes on the daily. They're performative instead of real.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 dark:text-white/60 text-[15px] mt-4">In marketing, our “voice” is the personality we embody when we show up for our audiences, community, partners, and employees. It's our vibe and flavor, the words we use and how we use them. We can dial up and down facets of our personality depending on the environment. Sound familiar? It's called life.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 dark:text-white/60 text-[15px] mt-4">We build trust when — interaction after interaction, channel after channel — we come across as the same “person.” In marketing, a verbal identity helps everyone who communicates on behalf of a brand to express themselves consistently so their audiences have the same powerful experience regardless of where they encounter the brand.</p>

Because like everything else in my life, I chose to go at writing the hard way instead of seeing the symbiotic nature of what I was doing for a living (building brands and telling stories) and how I could employ the tools I learned and built for myself in my writing life.</p>
